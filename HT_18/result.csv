To name a few examples: jQuery, Lodash, React.It seems like the benefits of this would be significant for both user and developer - faster loading, lower bandwidth, quicker builds, etc.It also seems eminently doable, technically. One possible high-level implementation off the top of my head:- A standard index of the most popular libs is maintained.- You pull them in via the script tag, with a new lib=&quot;name@version&quot; attribute. Older browsers can use the src tag as a backup.- SPA build systems like webpack et al are aware of the standard and can just not bundle libs pulled this way, while keeping the require() and import syntax.I do, however, see some pretty big not-strictly-technical difficulties:- The index would have to be administered by some entity. Who would that be, and who would pay for it?- Who defines what the most popular libs are? Whatever system is used, how do you prevent it being gamed to the advantage of particular libs?- Trust and security. A similar set of issues npm faces. Although that being the case, is this really introducing a new problem? It also seems like a much narrower problem if we're only talking about a small set of very popular libs.- Maybe some issues around licensing, bundling code into browsers etc. But again, if it's a smallish set of only very popular libs, this seems like it could be dealt with individually for each one and its authors, maybe as a prerequisite for getting included in the index.These difficulties are not insignificant, but nor do they seem insurmountable and also the benefits do seem genuinely worth it.It just appears to me to be something that should so obviously have been done, that there must be really good reasons why it hasn't been - maybe including those above, maybe technical, maybe others.Does anyone know if any serious attempt has ever been made at a proposal to do something like this, even if in a non-standard way by an individual browser vendor?*1643241265*Ask HN: Why don't browsers pre-include popular JavaScript libraries?*story

Maybe even push the data to a blockchain or something.Obviously this should be a feature of HN itself, it's pretty simple, but in lieu that it seems incredibly important for someone to build and maintain it.Even though the recent complaints about YC/Stripe are not fully founded (IMHO) there is no doubt that YC's dominance over the tech community's conversations is something to be watched very closely. They do very obviously have their thumb on the scale.There have been shenanigans in the past and there will be in the future. The conflict of interest is simply too strong.The most obvious issue today is that HN doesn't prevent voting rings for sufficiently large organizations, like YC itself. Why doesn't it prevent them?

iamarsibragimov*1*30092404*30095319*3*Developers are the most sought-after resource in IT, so large companies often offer them an option program along with their salary. This is when, after some time, the employee gets an opportunity to buy shares in the company at a fixed price, usually below the market price. This is generally very profitable. And so. A developer gets a job at such a company, they work off as long as they need to in order to obtain the highest possible conditions under the stock option program. As a rule, this is 1 year of cliff + 4 years of vesting. I'm not going to talk about cliff and vesting. To make a long story short, you have to work for 5 years. Immediately after that, the developer leaves for another company for the next option. Over a career of 20-25 years, the developer will get the most out of each company.

Over time, more games are played and everyone begins taking them more seriously. Soon the office separates into different cliques (marketing, sales, IT, etc), and the games evolve into competitive, office wide nerf gun fights. People start making bases out of their cubicles (roofs and all), eventually sleeping inside of them, fearing to leave them unguarded. It keeps escalating.

Functions longer than 20 lines of code? Pffff, an algorithm/problem can be such complex in nutshell and decomposing a function solving it will be non-relevant (see any std library of PL). Mutable global state? Pfff, anything in software is based on that, the problem is using it properly in target architecture (ex. in micro-controllers global state usually manages analog/digital output, calling a function for this adds memory and time overhead especially in real-time systems). Copy-paste? Pfff, similar code != this code solves the same problem, sometimes it's easier to include a change in &quot;copy-paste&quot; code than deciding how to include this in boundaries of &quot;reusable&quot; parts (ex. for the first time there're two structures X = (A, B) and Y = (A, B) with similar logic but different domains, and then manager decides to include specific logic for Y working with B data).Now my general principle which distinguishes &quot;good&quot; code from &quot;bad&quot; one, is how good it resembles a model solving given problem. It can be a non-neccessary complexity of code (ex. instead of &quot;if (isFinite(a)) { ... }&quot; writing &quot;if (a.toString() != &quot;Inifinity&quot; &amp;&amp; a.toString() != &quot;NaN&quot;) { ... }&quot; when &quot;a&quot; is simply a number).

novelica*2*30082614*30082655*5*Hey HN, I want to keep this transparent. I’ve made a tool to help people with the problem of needing consistent results, despite not having a controllable schedule. The site is just a signup, but later this week it’ll be on the App Store. The first part of this post is essentially a TLDR. The second part is the story behind it, if you like lifehacking.1. TLDR - What it is, why I made it, and what is solves:The tool pairs you with an assistant who will help you tailor your routines and habits around whatever you’re throwing at your schedule each hour. (https://www.athios.co)I made this because I’m a student at university and it’s incredibly hard to make progress using the well known habit-tracking and routine building approaches advocated by most lifehacker books and blogs. It’s just very difficult to have fun and do interesting new things when you have to make everything in your life routine-based to progress on your goals. I hope this is useful to you.2. The story behind the tool, if you're interested:When I was a junior in high school my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and as he lost his job, slowly but consistently many parts of my family’s life deteriorated since he was the only breadwinner of the family. By Senior year my mom was asking for donations on I-45 in Houston while I was at school. I had slept through most of high school, so community college was in my cards. I turned to lifehacking to get to the university of my dreams.2 years later when I finally got to the university I wanted to go: Everything fell apart. I stopped showing up to class. I slept all day. I over ate. I gained 30 pounds. I failed all my classes, and had a 1.8 GPA. I ended up using an app called Fabulous, it was a little expensive, but it really got my crap together. In about 4 months I went from ~245 lbs to ~215. I had never once in my life considered implementing a morning or evening routine, and it worked. I was rocking all A’s, and then a month later, the pandemic hit. I was still keeping my routines, and losing weight because of the looming threat of being expelled from the university, but by January 2021… I was done with this crap.I had heard of Future (a personal training app - it’s expensive) and I used it, while having my mother (reluctantly) look at my progress on my daily routines (from Fabulous) through a cheap little system I put together. Yes, because of Future, this was a very expensive experiment, but I wanted to lose a lot of weight and break into Software Engineering as a non-CS major. The results were pretty good. I went from ~215 lbs to 190 lbs in about 5-6 months, and got some internship offers, and kept progressing in my major at school. I think this worked because you always know someone is gonna see if you did it or not. From my findings, it certainly helps to use accountability in conjunction with routines and consistency, but the system for sure keeps you powering through changes, and since students are constantly moving apartments, cities, sleeping in, and procrastinating, this helped.Last semester, some friends wanted help with routines, so I started making a tool (on TestFlight) where I was the “coach” and I would create mixtures of the many methods learned from books, and apps I’ve tried. My goal was to help keep their streak going as long as possible. And if they broke it, my main priority was making sure they could restart it ASAP. The main thing that helped them was not just that they knew I’d see their routines, but that they could also talk to me about their routines. The friends I helped ended up sticking with it daily for 4 months (the entire semester). We’ve paused briefly since I’m making this into an app that’ll get into the app store.*1643180288*Lifehacking: Maintaining routines throughout uncontrollable schedules*story

Do alternatives like Ireland (low taxes) or Estonia (easy process) make sense when we would never actually move to those countries?

Additionally, it's very hard to get any feedback at all, since it's not comfortable for most people to talk about.Has anyone had to solve this for themselves? I understand it will be different for everyone, but I would be interested in hearing about any strategies or workarounds. I'm not that confident about being able to solve it with a therapist in the short term, so I'm open to other ideas, for example, hiring staff to aid in communications, or different communication strategies.Many thanks.*1643198482*Ask HN: Any startup founders that have dealt with emotional problems / PTSD?*story

They can submit about their project/startup idea along with the domain-name needed &amp; an interested investor can buy them the domain in return of a certain equity.I did some soft launches &amp; got some feedback. The thing is that this is not making sense to many people out there. They are saying that if a founder can't buy even a domain-name why would anybody invest in him or that the domain per say is not such a big investment &amp; there are many other expenses like hosting &amp; all.After all this feedback, I'm thinking of pivoting this into some sort of product hunt for investors where founders can submit there project, create a buzz, get signups &amp; thus attracts investors. The investors can browse along the products &amp; invest in any of them as an angel investor.But then again as per Y Combinator's Michael Siebel, great ideas always sound horrible at first &amp; people think they are not good enough.

It then takes about 5-10 more seconds for me to close all the popups and that's IF it doesn't fail along the way (which it does sometimes), IF I don't misclick anything (which the website makes painstakingly easy).All of that to load a list of 280 chars text messages, occasionally with a picture or a video. How come even my pocket supercomputer with 8 cores and 8GB RAM takes that much time to display just some text and pictures?It's yet worse with reddit.I do understand that some companies may be motivated to break their own websites to force users to install spyware (&quot;it's better in the app!&quot;), but making a broken website doesn't take dozens of megabytes of JS. Same slowness could be achieved with a few setTimeout()s. What's more, websites are slow even when they aren't trying to push an app down your throat - e.g. the desktop versions of those same websites are hardly better, and even websites that don't have an app to &quot;offer&quot; are oftentimes just as overengeneered.What I'm trying to understand is what is the motivation behind this? I wouldn't have any questions if webpages required manpower and optimizations to be fast - but on the contrary, anyone with most basic html skills can come up with a faster frontend than twitter's[1] AND cover that same functionality (text, a few images and a couple of forms - ALL of this is covered by HTML alone, doesn't even need a single line of JS!). This means that companies pay people to make their websites worse, and to do that in a laborious manner - again, not just some setTimeouts()s, but dozens of megabytes of code (and that's compressed!). And I can't help but wonder - what is the incentive for that? Why? A business should generally save money wherever possible and only spend it to make profits, shouldn't it? I just can't see how the crime against everything decent that is the twitter frontend could possibly benefit the company, or anyone for that matter. If anything it would harm it. And it costs it money.[1] - see e.g. Nitter, Invidious, Teddit - all of those much more robust than the sites they grab data from. Also pretty sure that even if the people behind these did get paid, it was orders of magnitude less than what the people these companies have working on their frontends get paid.*1643185552*Ask HN: Why does the modern web hate users?*story

I cannot find it.Many things I do are set-up once, but never revisited or changed for long periods of time.  Then, I have to re-google and learn again.  Often with out-dated documentation.For instance, I am currently working towards a cluster setup for containers and various apps.  I do not have a particular end-goal.  I am trying to expand my knowledge and and will be rebuilding as I break things.Since I am learning, I am copy/pasting a lot and have many disjointed tasks as I progress.  Many of the guides/tutorials have out-dated information which I then have to note again.I would like to jot down notes/commands and then come back to organize into actual procedures once I have things implemented properly.An example that came today was the need to add a secondary interface to Ubuntu for a VLAN.  I may never revisit this for years, but will need to repeat it sometime.It would be nice to be able to reference this VLAN procedure/notes and in-line them to a task note that was initially unrelated.  I may have forgotten that I ever made the notes in the first place and then duplicate it again.Right now, I am not building documentation, but noting things I am not sure are even correct yet that may end up as documentation.Almost like I need a tagging/searchable/dated system but I don't know what the tags would be yet.*1643078812*Ask HN: Note taking for initial learning and disorganized/related tasks*story

I'm trying to figure out what to do this summer.I've already ruled out internships at most tech companies b/c1. I spent a gap year working at a wide range of companies (big company, startup, research lab)2. I'm a reasonably good programmer with open-source projects and while I'm quite sure I have a lot lot more to learn, I don't think a tech internship is the highest-leverage use of my time3. (most important reason) I'm not sure I want to be a SWE. I love software engineering / programming, but when I think of the way to make the most impact in the world it's probably creating a (actually meaningful) startup/organization. (I know, I know, every young person says this these days)Given that this is the case, I'm trying to figure out what to do this summer besides a normal tech internship. I was contemplating how to figure out  what to do and decided on a &quot;meta-strategy&quot; of consulting people with more experience on forums such as HN.Here are the options I've come up with so far:1. Try to understand virality -- I'm not particularly good at creating viral content or content that appeals to the masses (aside from the natural edge that comes from being young), which could certainly be useful when marketing a product. An option here is trying to intern at a company like Buzzfeed which is full of people who understand emotions / virality.2. Try to understand soft skills / business -- There are roles out there like &quot;business development intern&quot;. I don't know anything about &quot;business development&quot; but negotiating with other companies / writing white-papers / etc. could be a useful skill3. Spend time learning on my own. To enact change these days, it's probably not sufficient to just know programming (unless you want to do a SASS). Spending time on my own learning physics/chemistry/biology could be useful. The issue here is I believe mentorship is useful and this option negates that completely.4. Working on my own business (not a software project). I've done this in the past &amp; learned a lot about how to be scrappy. Not a terrible idea, but I don't want to sink 3 months into something only to have to return to school. Also negates mentorship. Also I'd rather spend time learning right now so I can execute on something that's not a local maximum of what my brain can imagine right now."*1643142131*Ask HN: What should a student who is already decent at SWE do over the summer?*story

I finished my PhD 5 years ago, and have had three postdocs since then in three separate fields within the physical sciences (I can't give more detail here as I am afraid of uniquely identifying myself). I have been publishing first author papers at a rate of about 2 per year. I am particularly good at using ideas from one field to solve problems in another, which is why changing fields each postdoc has been a path of least resistance.Recently, I have solved a problem which feels significantly more important than what I have done in the past. It is one of those instances where you can use auto differentiation infrastructure to solve a problem which doesn't really look like machine learning. People in my lab are excited about it, but there does not seem to be any way for me to leverage this excitement into any sort of long term contract. All that is on offer is that the lab PIs want to write a proposal, which doesn't even mention my name, and then if that proposal gets funded, they will rehire me to work on the project (although, there are no guarantees that they will not hire someone else instead, which is a serious concern when multiple PIs are competing to hire someone). As a result of my field hopping, trying to become a PI myself isn't really an option.Is there any mechanism for applying for private sector research jobs where I can bring a project with a prototype along and be like &quot;let me develop this for you, and you can hire me as an employee&quot;, kind of like a proposal / job application combination? I am getting a little old to keep doing postdocs, so job security is becoming more of a priority for me.Anyway, not expecting much from posting this, I just thought I would try.*1643070226*Ask HN: Trading research breakthrough for a permanent job?*story

supermatou*2*30076816*30091685, 30079311*3*Anyone notice lately an increase of spam mails breaking through Gmail's (usually excellent) spam filters?I've had a Gmail account since its early beta and I've never seen so many spams worming their way into my inbox as I can see these days. Granted, I'm not submerged by spam, but after many years of having simply forgotten about the spam scourge (I would get maybe one or two per YEAR!), seeing three or four per week is quite irritating.Another thing I had noticed last year was the sheer number of messages accumulated in Spam; for decades there were just 150 or 200 at any given moment; starting last year, their number jumped considerably, and for a couple of months, Gmail's Spam folder had more than 1,000! Still, only very rarely I would see one in my inbox (I use IMAP and I exclude Spam from my subscribed folders; I only noticed their huge number when I had to use the web interface.)*1643139180*Ask HN: Spam Breaking Through (Gmail)*story

lmaaq314*2*30070128*30071659, 30083008*4*"I'm a Swiss citizen, 38-years old. I've been based out of Southeast Asia for close to ten years. During this time, I've mostly survived on past savings and odd online jobs. However, for various reasons, I'm no longer able to stay here and have to return to Switzerland.
I have little financial resources left, so I need a job fast. I will do anything within my capabilities. In the (distant) past, I worked in IT, but my tasks were mostly confined to simple code maintenance &amp; bug fixing. I also dabbled with Ruby on Rails during my free-time. That said, I didn't touch code in several years. However, I would be totally willing to try and get back into it, even at minimal pay. I would also consider related jobs, like IT support or DevOps.
If anyone has any pointers or tips, that would be greatly appreciated!

My current job is fully remote and, now I want to change the job, but I couldn't find any good platforms to find a proper remote job for the cybersecurity.Solution:
So, I've created this website(https://pwnremote.com) because I’ve seen many people, including myself, Who want to apply for jobs for remote work, but there is no platform for cybersecurity jobs and also, if you google also, there are not many results. That is why now, I’ve created this dedicated place that is only focused on Cyber Security Jobs. We want to protect the internet from anywhere in the world.Also, I know this is not a perfect website, but please be nice and give me a feedback, so i can learn and improve my website.Thanks,

encryptluks2*2*30062511*30063008*3*This is a warning to Xfinity customers. Today, I got a sophisticated spam email to an email address that was only ever provided to Xfinity. Note I am no longer an Xfinity customer since a few months ago, but my account still exists with Xfinity. I am using SimpleLogin to generate unique email addresses for every service that I signup for. Due to the way SimpleLogin forwards emails, I only have limited email header information. The email appears to be an invoice from Quickbooks for Norton AntiVirus suggesting I have a balance due of 256.89 for 5 copies of AntiVirus. The phone number provided, 1 (850) 806-2408, has a live person answer when called immediately suggested that I provide my credit card to cancel the order.The email appears to have been sent from Teamnort@saless.cc. Interestingly enough when trying a WHOIS on saless.cc it appears the domain is not registered. However, according to this article the TLDs have been hijacked before:https://labs.detectify.com/2021/01/15/how-i-hijacked-the-top-level-domain-of-a-sovereign-state/I immediately tried calling Xfinity to explain the issue to their security team, but their entry-level employees couldn't understand the issue. I did some searches and appears that other Xfinity customers have experienced similar phishing emails. In this instance, the only way someone could have gotten that email is if an Xfinity employee is leaking emails or there has been a data breach with customer emails. This email was updated in April of 2021, so the breach would have had to occur after that time. The email is unique enough that it wouldn't have been randomly sent, and note this is the first phishing email I've ever received from someone to my 400+ aliases that I'm using currently.*1643051901*Xfinity Data breach detected through email alias service*story
