The goal of this project is to enable more people to build such a list custom list to filter out low-quality content and nags.

Last year I started writing a book on my software development methodology. I put in ~80 hours and am ~25% done. I began getting discouraged and I wanted the practice of actually shipping an entire book from start to finish. I took 28 blog posts and combined them to create this book. I put in ~20 hours editing the book myself. I'm really happy to have this experience and am looking forward to resuming my other book.I used leanpub to generate the pdf and epubs. Leanpub has its own markdown flavor called markua. I was originally drawn to leanpub because it has a pretty popular tech listing website. I didn't actually list on leanpub because they only pay using paypal, so I listed on amazon KDP instead.Thank you!*1643061083*Show HN: I wrote a book on Site Reliability Engineering*story*

finishprobation*0*30071033* *4*Hey HN,I made FinishProbation.com to help people who have to take UAs everyday. It's an app that helps people complete their probation sentence. The app will notify you when you need to take a drug test (supporting over 20 states) and includes a probation progression tracker.My first experience with probation was when I was eighteen. My best friend's life was turned upside down by his marijuana possession charge. This charge would not have been as severe in today's times, but the punishment ruined his educational future and his emotional stability. He felt that he was trapped in a disorganized cycle and it was hard for him to see the end.This would later drive me on a mission to code FinishProbation for offenders like my buddy who was overwhelmed by his probation sentence. To reduce the mental stress and toll that probation brings. And this is done by reducing the fear of missing a drug test with notifications, seeing the days left to finish probation and spreading the word on how to get early termination.This app has helped the mental state of being on probation already a few people in Michigan and I trying to see if it can be adopted in courts across America.I believe if this gets adopted in the courts, then it leaves room for other ways for code to innovate our courts and outdated government process like a newly wed changing their last name. (don't get me started on my wife's journey through that)There's so much that can be updated with better processes in this world. If someone's head is on fire, and you hand them a brick, they will use a brick to put out that fire. So let's stop using bricks!Jules*1643113696*Show HN: Can code change our probation system?*story*https://finishprobation.com/?a=web1

m10k*2*30067708*30068071*2*Everyday, I have to deal with Bash scripts and all the code duplication and unreadableness that comes with it. One day I found myself implementing an include function so that I could easily modularize my scripts, and it worked better than I had anticipated. That's how toolbox started.At first, I wrote some simple modules for command line parsing and locking, but then I tried to see how far I could push the poor shell. I wrote modules for semaphores and &quot;thread&quot;-safe queues, and this is where things quickly started to escalate. To implement a distributed build system that automates packaging/signing/publishing of toolbox Debian packages, I wrote a module for message-based IPC that supports point-to-point and pub-sub communication. Performance was never a consideration, but it works really well without consuming excessive resources.Some of the modules are arguably serious abuse of the shell, but I found that toolbox makes it possible to write Bash scripts that are readable, testable, and reliable. Shell isn't a terribly nice language, but it's great for integrating and automating things, so I thought others might find this useful, too.(I am going to publish the build system as well, as soon as I am done writing the documentation.)*1643082495*Show HN: Toolbox – A framework for modular Bash scripts*story*https://m10k.eu/toolbox.html

1. Powered by golang you can run load tests for tens of thousands of connections per second on very average hardware.
2. Cross platform, run it on Windows or Mac or host it on your linux machines
3. Lets you load test databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongodb out of the box.
4. Will keep adding more load testing targets in the future (even the more esoteric ones)I hope to open source Loadjitsu soon and let users contribute new targets.

trzy*0*30076740* *2*I built a complete game using Snap's AR platform in about 6 weeks. I'd been intrigued by Snap's AR ambitions and wanted to kick the tires on their platform.The YouTube video description contains a link to the Lens: https://lens.snapchat.com/d04efc6953fd498c87e25c92fef727e7?s...How to play:- Joypad y axis moves the helicopter along the ray pointing from the camera. You can therefore tilt the phone up to fly &quot;up&quot;.- Altitude is also controlled by aiming the phone. The helicopter tries to match the altitude of a point that is fixed in front of the camera. So you can move up by aiming up or by actually lifting the phone higher.- Joypad x axis strafes.- If you lose track of the helicopter, a blue arrow will appear after about 5 seconds.- Blow up enemies and try to stay alive :)How it works under the hood:- Loads of JavaScript. Lenses are surprisingly programmer-friendly. As a non-artist, this is great. Almost everything can be driven completely by code, although most creators opt to use pre-made components with minimal scripting.- The game uses a custom physics engine with OBB-based collision detections that I wrote from scratch. Snap now has integrated physics that seem to be based on PhysX (i.e., the same as Unity's) but this was released well into my development process after I had already rolled my own.- I opted not to use environmental mesh reconstruction because it is performance intensive and gives dubious results on lower-end phones. When I started development, it was only enabled for Lidar-based phones but is since available everywhere.- I instead detect horizontal planes using an API that Snap hasn't really documented. I found a snippet of code in their API docs and opened up the Lens Studio .exe to find the names of the other plane events I needed.- Planes are used to create collision boxes that extend to the floor so the helicopter can bump into furniture.- AI-controlled enemy helicopters plot routes using a heightmap generated from the plane data to avoid colliding with obstacles when possible.Takeaways:- This has arguably become my favorite AR prototyping platform. Much faster idea-to-PoC iteration time than anything else out there.- The platform is surprisingly full-featured.- The Lens Studio Editor is remarkably polished and, despite some bugs here and there, is very stable.- The deployment story is second to none. Deploying to the phone involves a single click and is done over the Internet (no need for any tethering or wireless pairing).- Debugging on-device is still challenging (all you can do is log a few lines) but I was assured that an actual debugger is coming soon.- Economic viability: unfortunately, it is not really possible to directly monetize lenses. Most creators contract with brands to create branded lenses.Future plans:- I'll definitely be keeping an eye on Snap's ecosystem.- No plans for any more full-fledged lenses but I do have some ideas for prototypes I'd like to try in anticipation of commercially viable mixed reality HMDs hitting the market soon (e.g., Meta's Project Cambria).- I may update the game with a tutorial mode and a co-located multiplayer mode (co-op play or PvP) provided I get the necessary support from the Snap dev team.Hope you enjoy and are inspired to dive into AR if you haven't already :D*1643138876*Show HN: A full AR helicopter action game built as a Snap lens*story*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_1dJ_x7vXw

kaffediem*2*30044400*30044912*6*dIM Chat is a peer-2-peer chat app for iOS which works without internet but instead uses Bluetooth.I was inspired by the Briar project[1] and wondering why there was no such thing for iOS, so I decided to build one. There are still a few things major things which are WiP such as group messaging. The goal of the project is to allow demonstrants to communicate while the mobile data signal is shut off.Messages are e2ee and the code is Open Source.Try it out on the App Store[2].Any feedback is appreciated.[1]: https://briarproject.org[2]: https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/dim-chat/id1583606879*1642924074*Show HN: Dim – Peer2peer Bluetooth chat app for iOS*story*https://www.dimchat.org
